# GitHub Actions Demo

GitHub Actions is a powerful feature on GitHub that allows you to create custom automated workflows, enabling you to automate various aspects of your software development lifecycle (SDLC) and implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## Demo Steps

1. **Signup and Login to GitHub.com**: If you haven't already, sign up for a GitHub account and log in.

2. **Create a New Repository**: Create a new repository where you'll be setting up your workflows.

3. **Create a Workflows Folder**: Inside your repository, create a folder named `.github/workflows`. This is where you'll store your workflow configuration files.

4. **Create a Workflow File**: Inside the `.github/workflows` folder, create a YAML file with a `.yml` extension. This YAML file will define your workflow.

5. **Define Workflow Content**: Add the content of your workflow to the YAML file. This includes specifying the events that trigger the workflow, defining the jobs to be performed, and specifying the steps within each job.

6. **Commit and Push Changes**: Commit the changes you made to the repository and push them to GitHub.

7. **Navigate to Actions Tab**: Go to your repository's main page on GitHub and click the "Actions" tab. Here, you'll be able to see the status of your workflows.

8. **Check Workflow Logs and Results**: Select the workflow you created from the left sidebar to view detailed logs and results of the workflow execution.

## Key Terms

- **Workflow**: A collection of jobs defined in a YAML file, which automates a specific set of actions in your repository.
- **Events**: Any activity in the repository that can trigger a workflow to run.
- **Jobs**: Individual tasks or collections of steps to be executed within a workflow.
- **Steps**: Actions to be taken within a job, which can include commands or scripts to be executed.
- **Chaining Jobs**: Defining dependencies between jobs using the `needs` keyword in the workflow configuration.

By following these steps and understanding the key terms, you can leverage GitHub Actions to automate your software development workflows effectively.
